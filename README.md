For this task, the goal was to predict the concentration of PM2.5 per cubic meter in the air, given the relative 2D coordinates of locations on a map, along with a binary variable indicating whether that point lies in a residential area.

## Approximate Bayesian inference via SWA-Gaussian

For this task, our objective was to implement [SWA-Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02476) for classifying land usage type. We utilized 60x60 RGB satellite images along with the corresponding class labels indicating the type of land usage in each image. Additionally, we aimed to ensure that our model would be well-calibrated, meaning that the uncertainty in our predictions aligns with their accuracy.

In this task we use Bayesian optimization to optimize drug candidate's structural features for absorption and distribution, aiming for high bioavailability (logP) and easy synthesis.

In this project we implemented an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm  to control and swing-up an [inverted pendulum](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_pendulum/).
