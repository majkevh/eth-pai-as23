For this task, the goal was to predict the concentration of PM2.5 per cubic meter in the air, given the relative 2D coordinates of locations on a map, along with a binary variable indicating whether that point lies in a residential area.

In this regression task where we aimed to predict the PM2.5 levels based on x-y coordinates and the designation of these coordinates as residential areas. We addressed this task by initially undersampling the data to include only the most relevant data points, achieved through K-means clustering. Subsequently, we fitted a Gaussian Process model with a Mat√©rn kernel and white noise to the data.

In this task we use Bayesian optimization to optimize drug candidate's structural features for absorption and distribution, aiming for high bioavailability (logP) and easy synthesis. We'll adjust parameter $x$ to balance logP and synthetic accessibility, targeting optimal features $x^*$ with high logP and feasible synthesizability.

In this project we implemented an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm  to control and swing-up an [inverted pendulum](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_pendulum/).
