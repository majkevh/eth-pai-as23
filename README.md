In this regression task where we aimed to predict the PM2.5 levels based on x-y coordinates and the designation of these coordinates as residential areas. We addressed this task by initially undersampling the data to include only the most relevant data points, achieved through K-means clustering. Subsequently, we fitted a Gaussian Process model with a Mat√©rn kernel and white noise to the data.
